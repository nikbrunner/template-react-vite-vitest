# Review: Todo List - 2025-01-29

**Score:** 8/10
**Mode:** Learning session (no timer, ~2 hours)

## What Worked Well

- **Component architecture**: Good separation with `TodoItem` as its own component
- **Lib utilities**: Smart use of `createTodo` and `getFilteredTodos` as reusable functions with separate tests
- **Derived types pattern**: Single source of truth for filter options:

    ```ts
    const filters = [
        { type: "all", label: "All" },
        { type: "active", label: "Active" },
        { type: "completed", label: "Completed" }
    ] as const;

    export type Filter = (typeof filters)[number]["type"];
    ```

    This ensures the type stays in sync with the data - add a filter to the array and everything updates automatically.

- **Test coverage**: Comprehensive tests covering all CRUD operations plus filtering
- **RTL patterns learned**:
    - `userEvent.setup()` for modern user interaction
    - `within()` for scoped queries
    - Re-querying DOM after state changes
    - `toHaveAttribute('name', 'value')` syntax
    - `selectOptions()` for dropdowns
- **CSS approach**: Grid layout for TodoItem is clean and maintainable
- **TypeScript**: Proper types throughout, good use of `Filter` union type

## Patterns Learned

| Pattern                | Example                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Re-query after actions | `expect(within(list).getAllByRole('listitem')).toHaveLength(2)`        |
| Attribute assertions   | `toHaveAttribute('data-completed', 'true')` (two args, not one string) |
| Select interactions    | `await user.selectOptions(filter, 'Active')`                           |
| Test helper functions  | Extract repeated setup into `async function createTodo()`              |

## Interview Readiness

- [x] Ready to move on
- [ ] Needs one more attempt
- [ ] Review fundamentals first

The learning approach was solid. All core patterns are understood - the bugs found were minor (signature mismatch, CSS typo) not conceptual gaps.

## Recommended Next Steps

2. **Try exercise 03 (Form Validation)** to practice controlled inputs and validation logic
3. **Optional challenge**: Add keyboard accessibility to TodoItem (currently only clickable, not focusable)
